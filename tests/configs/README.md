This folder is not part of the `pytest` test scripts batery. These are a set of Tauren-MD configuration files that can be used to manually test the overall functionally of the program.

Files in this folder are considered *underdevelopment* and have no official support; **they may work but because they may not be updated to the lastest Tauren-MD version**, for now,they are placed here for storage purposes.


*Latested updated version: 0.6.2*
